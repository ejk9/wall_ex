# WallEx

A simple multi-user drawing canvas app.

## Deployment

Deployment is done with Heroku (see `Procfile` and `app.json` for configuration).

Each PR should create a review app automatically that can be used for verifying any changes before promoting them to staging or production.

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
